I recommend using violent monkey which is really easy to install and acts as a regular google extension, however, some would rather have the real
tampermonkey. It also acts as an extension but it is blocked by the administrator, heres the tool you will need to get the og tampermonkey.

once you have it, visit the tampermonkey extension page 

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en 

pin the crx file downloader and download it as a zip. press enter, and then go to the chromebook files. double click the zip so it pops up.
And then copy those files to an regular folder. press the 3 dot button in google chrome, hover over more tools, and select extensions.
turn on developer mode, hit load unpacked, select the folder you put the zip files into, and your done. turn on the extension and pin it.
